      "The genuine leather Outback Outfitter collection comes in pink sunset and camel back brown offering a shapely fit to show off your silhouette while you ride the streets, or the outback. Chest and waist pockets have good width for storing keys and small wallets. Ventilation pockets allow for a cooler ride but can be zipped up for protection in wind and rain. All jackets come with CE level 1 armour in the shoulders, elbows and back. This armour is removable too so you can look stylish on and off the bike! The outback outfitter is true to size, however, if you wish to layer underneath and use this as your winter choice, we suggest going a size up.",
